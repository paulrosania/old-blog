<div id="about">
  <p>
    My name is Paul Rosania. I grew up in Rye Beach, New Hampshire.
  </p>

  <p>
    I attended Phillips Exeter Academy, and later Dartmouth College, where I
    graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2005.
  </p>

  <p>
    After graduating, I spent three years in consulting (Ernst & Young,
    Mercatus) and three years in entrepreneurship (Careplace,
    CollegeJobConnect). In its heyday, Careplace was one of the largest online
    healthcare communities, with over 30,000 members.

  <p>
    I am currently a Product Manager at Twitter.

  <p>
    When I am not working, I am running, bodysurfing or snowboarding, depending
    on the season. I am an avid technologist and spend much of my free time
    tinkering. You can see some of the results on Github.
