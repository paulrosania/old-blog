*This is Part Three of a four-part post on Facebook's challenges in 2012. If you'd

As Facebook gears up for the biggest IPO in history, it faces unprecedented
challenges to future growth. With expansion rates in the US and Europe stabilizing,
Facebook relies more and more on emerging markets for growth.  And yet, there is
a big black hole in Facebook's social graph, right where China should be. The
Senate and FTC are eyeing Facebook as keenly as ever. To top things off,
Facebook's largest competitor is making an open declaration of war.

### Part Three: Regulation

(sort of a dance between competing objectives)

Opening up to congress/welcoming oversight
Trying to avoid additional privacy legislation
Avoiding antitrust concerns (in particular, the deal with Spotify requires all (new?) Spotify users to use Facebook to sign up -- that type of thing is the Department of Justice's bread and butter, but also really good biz for FB)
(Very) recently there was some news about anti-poaching "Gentlemen's" agreements between a bunch of the big tech companies (Google, Apple, etc.) -- not sure if Facebook got caught up in this, but it's totally illegal (again, good biz though with the talent situation the way it is)

Communicating change

policy/policy change to existing users (and the world in general, at this point given how big they are)

Penetration in US and EU is > 50% (some ests here:  http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-statistics/ )
In the US and EU, (and possibly elsewhere) retaining customers is almost as important as growth, since there's not a ton of room left to grow
Policy backlash is the primary situation where FB finds itself in a negative press situation with the media
A lot of the backlash historically has stemmed from failure to communicate policy changes ahead of time
Sometimes FB (Zuck in particular?) wants to make a change that they know people won't like at first, but is better -- how do you handle that situation gracefully?  (Newsfeed is a particular example of this, people hated it -- now it is the #1 feature of FB)
Dovetails with the goal of trying to avoid legislation -- often legislation emerges from investigations that get kicked off during bad press stemming from a FB policy change
