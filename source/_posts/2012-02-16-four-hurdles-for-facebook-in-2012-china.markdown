*This is Part One of a four-part post on Facebook's challenges in 2012. If you'd

As Facebook gears up for the biggest IPO in history, it faces unprecedented
challenges to future growth. With expansion rates in the US and Europe stabilizing,
Facebook relies more and more on emerging markets for growth.  And yet, there is
a big black hole in Facebook's social graph, right where China should be. The
Senate and FTC are eyeing Facebook as keenly as ever. To top things off,
Facebook's largest competitor is making an open declaration of war.

### Part Two: China

450mm Internet users
Facebook's currently blocked
Facebook maybe did a deal with Baidu (bigger than Google for search in China) in April but I don't know if this was ever confirmed, or if it alters their blocked status partially (or totally?)
China's sovereign wealth funds have reportedly considered buying a piece of Facebook (all sorts of issues with that, if it happened)
