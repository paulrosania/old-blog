### Competition

Dealing with Google+ (abbreviated in the industry as G+)

Probably the only major threat right now (I would be surprised if they are particularly worried about Twitter at the moment)
90mm users according to Google, questionable how many are active though, definite incentive to mask the numbers
Deeply integrated with Google Search
If Google can make using G+ a natural part of using gmail or search, it can cut pretty deeply into the reasons for people to use Facebook (at least in theory)
At this point, as long as the masses are using a Google product (gmail and search in particular) Facebook is at a severe competitive risk to G+, since it's clear that Google plans to deeply integrate G+ into those products
IMO, creating an alternative to gmail and google search should be an urgent strategic priority for Facebook

### China

450mm Internet users
Facebook's currently blocked
Facebook maybe did a deal with Baidu (bigger than Google for search in China) in April but I don't know if this was ever confirmed, or if it alters their blocked status partially (or totally?)
China's sovereign wealth funds have reportedly considered buying a piece of Facebook (all sorts of issues with that, if it happened)

### Regulation

(sort of a dance between competing objectives)

Opening up to congress/welcoming oversight
Trying to avoid additional privacy legislation
Avoiding antitrust concerns (in particular, the deal with Spotify requires all (new?) Spotify users to use Facebook to sign up -- that type of thing is the Department of Justice's bread and butter, but also really good biz for FB)
(Very) recently there was some news about anti-poaching "Gentlemen's" agreements between a bunch of the big tech companies (Google, Apple, etc.) -- not sure if Facebook got caught up in this, but it's totally illegal (again, good biz though with the talent situation the way it is)

### Communicating change

policy/policy change to existing users (and the world in general, at this point given how big they are)

Penetration in US and EU is > 50% (some ests here:  http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-statistics/ )
In the US and EU, (and possibly elsewhere) retaining customers is almost as important as growth, since there's not a ton of room left to grow
Policy backlash is the primary situation where FB finds itself in a negative press situation with the media
A lot of the backlash historically has stemmed from failure to communicate policy changes ahead of time
Sometimes FB (Zuck in particular?) wants to make a change that they know people won't like at first, but is better -- how do you handle that situation gracefully?  (Newsfeed is a particular example of this, people hated it -- now it is the #1 feature of FB)
Dovetails with the goal of trying to avoid legislation -- often legislation emerges from investigations that get kicked off during bad press stemming from a FB policy change
